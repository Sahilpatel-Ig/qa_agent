Hereâ€™s a sample .gitignore file tailored for Python projects. It helps keep your repository clean by ignoring unnecessary files and directories:
Gitignore# Byte-compiled files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environment
qa_agent/
output/


# Distribution / Packaging
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/
.eggs/

# Installer logs
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt

# Unit test / Coverage reports
htmlcov/
.tox/
.nox/
.coverage
*.cover
*.py,cover
.cache
nosetests.xml
coverage.xml
*.log

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# PyCharm project files
.idea/

# VSCode settings
.vscode/

# macOS system files
.DS_Store

# Windows system files
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Other
*.sqlite3
*.db
*.log

This file can be customized further based on your specific project needs. For example, if you use a specific tool or framework, you might need to add its related files or directories to the .gitignore.

web_roi_selector.py
